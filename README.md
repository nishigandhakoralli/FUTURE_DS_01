## Key Business Insights
After analyzing the data, the following critical insights were identified:
Profitability: The overall profit margin stands at 12.5%. While sales are trending upwards, profitability is heavily impacted by specific losses.
Underperforming Categories: The 'Tables' and 'Bookcases' sub-categories are currently operating at a loss despite high sales volume.
The Discount Effect: There is a strong negative correlation between high discounts and margin. Discounts exceeding 20% are consistently linked to negative profit margins.
Shipping Efficiency: The average time to ship is 3.96 days, successfully meeting the corporate SLA target of under 4 days.

## Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI Desktop: For data visualization and dashboard design.
